								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, California and moved to Portland, Oregon in 2006. I initially went to school for business management with a focus on digital marketing. Eventually I found that I didn't like it as much in the workforce and decided to pursue website development. Before I decided to pursue coding, I was working multiple jobs which included <span class="jobs">delivering bagels</span> to coffee shops around Portland, <span class="jobs">cashiering and baristaing</span> at a boba tea shop,and a <span class="jobs">server</span> at a sushi restuarant.</p>
